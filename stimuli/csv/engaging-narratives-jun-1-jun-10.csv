background,"Every day, Alice goes to work.
Whenever she leaves, she makes sure she has her lunchbox, her keys, and her favorite jacket.
She usually hangs up her favorite jacket in her bedroom closet, puts her keys on top of the bedroom dresser, and places her lunchbox on the kitchen counter.","Every day around noon, Alice starts feeling hungry.
There are a number of food options around her: a vending machine in the office building that sells ramen and chips, a pizza place down the block from her office, and a burger joint, which is past the pizza place and around the corner.
The vending machine is always open, and both of the restaurants are usually open as well. ","Each week, Alice plays a few rounds of ping pong with her colleagues after work.
She's one of the best players out of all her colleagues.
The rackets are a little old, though, and sometimes people will lose a round just because they happened to get a bad paddle.
Alice and her friends play three rounds of doubles together, and whoever loses the most rounds out of three has to buy the other team lunch the next day.","On Saturdays, Alice often goes to the park.
The park has lots of things to do -- a grassy lawn, a community pool, and a baseball field where people can watch the local game.
She usually arranges to meet up with her friend Billy, where they'll often picnic, swim, or watch a game together.","There is a mall in Alice's town.
It has a shoe store, a bookstore, and a foodcourt. 
She's heard that her favorite celebrity might be at the mall today, and wants to go there to find him.
However, she knows he travels discreetly and that the odds of catching him there are pretty slim.","Alice often visits her Dad on the weekends.
Her Dad has a sweet tooth, and always has at least one bar of chocolate and a box of cookies in the house.
He hides them, because he knows that Alice also has a sweet tooth, and doesn't want her to take them. 
She knows his hiding places well, and he often hides his snacks in the highest pantry shelf in the kitchen, and in the cupboard in the bathroom.
Her Dad is often not home, which makes sneaking a snack pretty easy.
On the rare occasion that he is, he is pretty watchful, since he doesn't want her to take his snacks!"
